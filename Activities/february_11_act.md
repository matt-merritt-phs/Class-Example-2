# Activity 2/11

Today, we will take our first look at scripting, which allows us to control all sorts of things about our GameObjects.

## Review: Visual Studios Installation

If you have not already, you are strongly encouraged to install Visual Studios. 

1. Open Unity Hub.
2. Select Installs from the left.
3. Search for version 6000.3.6f1.
4. Click on the settings option on the right, and select "Add modules".
5. Select "Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022" and press install.
6. When the second installer window appears, notify me.

## Review: Changing the Input System

Additionally, we will need to change the Input System to use the old Input Manager. This will require us to restart our project a couple times, so make sure everything is saved before doing this.

1. Open your Unity Project
2. On the top ribbon, look under "Edit"
3. Select "Project Settings" from the bottom
4. Navigate to the page called "Player"
5. Expand "Other Settings"
6. Under "Configuration" in the middle, change "Active Input Handling" from "Input System Package (New)" to "Input Manager (Old)"
7. Restart Unity when prompted
8. Press the play button, and restart the Unity editor when prompted

## Live Demo: Scripting with Transforms

Make sure to follow along with the demonstration.

## Activity

Based on the demonstration, modify the movement script to allows your object both forwards and backwards.

Once you have that working, try adding side to side movement with A and D.

If you get all of that working, copy your script and try to implement rotation with Q and E. 

At the end of class, upload a copy of your scripts to Google Classroom.
